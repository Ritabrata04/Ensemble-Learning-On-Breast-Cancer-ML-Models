Multiple machine learning models such as Logistic Regression,Support Vector Machines(SVM),K-Nearest Neighbour(KNN),Random Forest(RF),Decision Trees are used on the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset.
The models are examined independently and also compared to each other.
The aim is to create a classifier model using the help of Principal Component Analysis(PCA) and hyperparameter tuning(GridSearch CV).
Two cases of voting are observed using ensemble learning:
1.Hard voting(mode)
2.Soft voting(mean)
Future prospect of the project is to introduce bootstrap aggregating and boosting ensemble methods.
